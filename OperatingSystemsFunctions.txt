1. One function of an operating system is to boot the computer, or in other words, to start it. The devices startup instructions are accessed from the hard drive when the power turns on. These instructions may include loading the user interface or running any antivirus softwares.
2. Another function of operating systems is to provide the user with a user interface. This can be a graphical user interface, which allows you to interact directly with what you are seeing, or a command-line interface, which prompts you to type certain commands as input to produce output. Because command-line interafaces require exact spelling, GUIs are considered more user-friendly and are more common amongst consumer devices.
