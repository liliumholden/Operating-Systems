1. One function of an operating system is to boot the computer, or in other words, to start it. The device's startup instructions are accessed when the power turns on. These instructions may include loading the user interface or running any antivirus softwares.
2. Another function of operating systems is to provide the user with a user interface. This can be a graphical user interface, which allows you to interact directly with what you are seeing, or a command-line interface, which prompts you to type certain commands as input to produce output. Because command-line interafaces require exact spelling, GUIs are considered more user-friendly and are more common amongst consumer devices.
3. Operating systems also function to manage device drivers. When a device such as a printer, camera, or mouse is plugged into a computer, it has specific instructions on how to interact with the computer. This information is stored on the device driver. Operating systems manage these drivers and access them and their instructions when necessary.
